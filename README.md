# Practical-Data-Science
Hands-on Data Science projects showcasing skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning using Python.

### About this Repository
This repository contains my collection of hands-on projects, exercises, and notebooks as I explore the world of Data Science and Machine Learning. Each project is built with a focus on learning practical skills and working with real-world datasets.

Whether it's data cleaning, visualization, or building predictive models, this repository reflects my journey in mastering Data Science one step at a time.

### Skills Demonstrated
ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and data normalization.
ðŸ“Š Data Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover insights.
ðŸ¤– Machine Learning: Implementing regression, classification, clustering, and more using Scikit-Learn.
ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation: Understanding metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE.
